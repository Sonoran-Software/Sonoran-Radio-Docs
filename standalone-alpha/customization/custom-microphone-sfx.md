# Custom Microphone SFX

## Custom Microphone Clicks

When a user presses down their push-to-talk key, a "key-down" sound effect is played.

When a user releases their push-to-talk key, a "key-up" sound effect is played.

Sonoran Radio allows these sound effects to be customized!

### Community-Wide SFX

Customize the default key-up and key-down SFX for the entire community in the `Server Settings` tab.

This requires the `Admin` permission.

Once configured, all users in your community will broadcast these SFX options, unless they have a per-user SFX specified.

### Per-User SFX

Individual users can customize their key-up and key-down SFX in their user settings dialog in their radio or dispatch portal.

Once configured, the user will override any default or community-wide SFX.

_Note: SFX uploads can not be processed using the in-game radio._
