## Usage - Turning on/off your Radio

You can click on the dial on the top right of the radio to toggle the radio on and off. You will also see this reflected in the teamspeak interface.

## Usage - Change Frequency

To change your current frequency, either use the dial on the top of the radio, use the keybinds that you set in the Keybinds Menu, or click on the current frequency. You can set a custom frequency or you can select a preset. You can click on either side of the knob on the middle top of the radio to go to the previous or next preset.

## Usage - Add/Remove Scan Frequency

To add frequency to scan list, set your radio to that frequency, click on scan list, and press the plus button. Press the x button next to a frequency to remove from the scan list.

## Usage - Activating Panic Button

Usage of the panic button requires the sonrad plugin for the Sonoran CAD. You can download and install that plugin here: [Sonoran CAD Sonrad Plugin](https://github.com/Sonoran-Software/sonoran_sonrad)
