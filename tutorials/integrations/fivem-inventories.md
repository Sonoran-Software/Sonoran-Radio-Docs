# FiveM Inventories

## QBCore

QBCore inventory support for the radio and [radio scanner](../usage/in-game-radio/radio-scanners.md) items is automatically detected.

### Configuration

#### Inventory Restriction

To restrict radio and scanner access to users with the radio item in their inventory, set `config.enforceRadioItem` to `true`.

#### Inventory Item

Customize your radio and scanner items in your config.lua's `Config.RadioItem` and `Config.ScannerItem` objects.

<details>

<summary>Config.Lua Properties</summary>

```lua
-- Located in the Radio's config.lua
Config.RadioItem = {		 -- Note: Changes to this item will require a server restart to take effect
	name = 'sonoran_radio',  -- Item name in your inventory | STRING
	label = 'Sonoran Radio', -- Label for the item in your inventory | STRING
	weight = 1, 			 -- Weight of the item in your inventory | INT
	description = 'Communicate with others through the Sonoran Radio', -- Description of the item in your inventory | STRING
}
Config.ScannerItem = {
	name = 'sonoran_radio_scanner', -- Item ID
	label = 'Sonoran Radio Scanner', -- Label for the item in your inventory
	weight = 1, -- Weight of the item in your inventory
	description = 'Listen to radio chatter with the Sonoran Radio Scanner', -- Description of the item in your inventory
}
