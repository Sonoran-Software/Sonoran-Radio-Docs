# Troubleshooting

## Pressing Y does not open a menu

This is expected. Sonoran Radio does not add an Arma radio dialog or `Y` keybind. Open the Sonoran Radio desktop app, connect to a Radio channel, and select **Open Overlay**.

## The overlay receives no tower signal

Check the following:

1. CBA_A3 and Sonoran Radio are loaded on both the server and client.
2. The Sonoran Radio desktop overlay is open.
3. A tower module exists and **Powered** is enabled.
4. **Active dishes** is greater than zero.
5. The player is inside the tower's configured range.
6. A destructible physical tower has not been killed or deleted.
7. Terrain attenuation is not reducing an already weak edge-of-range signal.
8. **Sonoran audio bridge** is enabled in **Options** > **Addon Options** > **Sonoran Radio**.

Enable **Signal logging** in the same CBA settings page to write signal changes to the client RPT log. Arma normally stores client RPT files under:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Arma 3
```

## The local bridge is not running

Visit:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:39114/health
```

If the page does not load:

1. Confirm `sonoran_radio_x64.dll` and the `bridge` directory remain in `@sonoran_radio`.
2. Confirm PowerShell is available and security software did not quarantine the DLL or bridge script.
3. Confirm another application is not using UDP port `39113` or HTTP port `39114`.
4. Run `@sonoran_radio\bridge\start-bridge.cmd` as a manual fallback, then reload the health page.

The bridge is localhost-only. Firewall port forwarding is not required.

## The wrong radio frame is displayed

1. Confirm the exact item class is listed on the intended frame under **Customization** > **Desktop Frames**.
2. Save the frame configuration.
3. Close and reopen the desktop overlay to download the changed mappings.
4. Give the player only one intended radio item. The assigned radio is preferred; otherwise the first detected inventory radio is used.
5. Wait up to two seconds after changing the inventory item.

Class matching is case-insensitive. If an item has no mapping, the overlay leaves the current frame selected.

## The BLUFOR or OPFOR frame is missing

Newly created communities include the example ARMA 3 BLUFOR and ARMA 3 OPFOR frames. For an older community, create or select a desktop frame and add the corresponding class manually:

```text
SonoranRadio_Item_BLUFOR
SonoranRadio_Item_OPFOR
```

## AI does not react to radio traffic

1. Enable **AI can hear transmissions** in the mission-wide CBA addon settings.
2. Confirm the desktop overlay—not Arma proximity voice—is actively transmitting.
3. Confirm the AI is alive, is not player-controlled, and is inside the configured hearing range.
4. Confirm the local bridge health endpoint works.
5. Remember that the same AI is updated at most once every 20 seconds and AI that already know the player's location do not need another reveal.

TFAR is not required and does not control this setting.

## A tower cannot be destroyed

Invisible towers have no physical object and cannot take damage. For a physical tower, edit its module and make sure **Indestructible** is disabled. If a synchronized editor object has its own mission damage protection, remove that protection as well.
