# Configure a Game Integration

Each Sonoran Radio community server can be configured for **FiveM** or **Emergency Response: Liberty County (ER:LC)**. Your selection controls the setup tools shown under **Game Integration** and the map used for emergency zones under **Zones**.

Open your Radio community, then navigate to **Customize** > **Game Integration**.

## FiveM

Select **FiveM** to display the existing FiveM resource setup and download tools.

Continue with [Installing the In-Game Resource](installing-the-in-game-resource.md) to download and configure the resource.

## ER:LC

Select **ER:LC** to connect an ER:LC private server and enable location-based radio signal.

### 1. Link Your Roblox Account

Radio matches your Sonoran account to your player in ER:LC through your linked Roblox account. If your account is not linked, a red banner appears at the top of the Game Integration panel.

1. Select **Link Roblox**.
2. Sign in to Roblox in the new window and authorize the account link.
3. Return to Sonoran Radio. The banner will disappear once the link is detected.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Every Radio user who wants ER:LC location-based signal must link the Roblox account they use to play ER:LC.
{% endhint %}

A Roblox account link already completed through another Sonoran product is reused by Radio.

### 2. Create an ER:LC API Key

ER:LC API access requires the private server's paid **API Pack** upgrade.

1. In ER:LC, open **Menu** > **Servers** > **Owned Servers**.
2. Select your private server, then open **Upgrade Packs** > **API Pack** if it is not already enabled.
3. Join the private server and open **Server Info**.
4. Select **Edit Server Settings**.
5. Navigate to **ER:LC API**, select **Edit**, and copy the API key.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Treat the ER:LC API key like a password. Do not post it in Discord, screenshots, source code, or other public locations.
{% endhint %}

### 3. Link the Private Server

1. Paste the key into **ER:LC API Key**.
2. Select **Link Server**.
3. Confirm that the panel displays **Hub synced** and the private server's join code.

The API key is stored securely by Sonoran Radio and is not returned to players or displayed again. To replace it, enter a new key and select **Update Link**.

To disconnect the private server, select **Unlink** and confirm the prompt. Live player positions and ER:LC signal updates stop until another server is linked.

### 4. Configure Signal Coverage

The **Virtual Signal Towers** editor appears directly below the ER:LC private-server settings. You can lay out towers before linking the server, but the server must be synced before Radio can display live players or update their signal.
