# Invite and Manage Users

## Automatic Join, Kick, Ban, and Permission Sync

Sonoran CMS allows you to automatically add and manage user permissions with user applications, sync them with Discord roles, and more!

If you are building your own integration, Sonoran Radio also exposes API endpoints to approve members, kick members, ban members, update member display names, and set member permissions.

## FiveM Management

All user permission management, including inviting and approving members, can be automated with FiveM ACE permissions.

## Manual User Management

### Inviting Members

Users will need the `Community ID` located in the `Administrator` panel.\
Communities can also [customize this community ID](../usage/dispatch-panel/custom-domain-vanity-url.md#vanity-urls).

When logged into Sonoran Radio, they can select the `+` button in the portal to paste in the `Community ID`.

### Approving Members

When a member joins your community with an invite code, they will be pending until approved.

Users with the `Approve Pending Members`  permission can approve in the `Members` tab
