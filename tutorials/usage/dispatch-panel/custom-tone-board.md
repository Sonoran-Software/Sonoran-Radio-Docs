## Configuring the Tone Board

Here, you can customize the name, icon, and color of existing tones or use the trash icon to remove a tone. Tones are sorted alphabetically.

Or, use the bottom section to upload and configure a new tone.

#### Repeating Tones

For repeated tones, you can hover over the active tone to see what channels and groups it's playing to.

Additionally, the UI will reflect the remaining play count and show a progress bar for the delay until the next play.
