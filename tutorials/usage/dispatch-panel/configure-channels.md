## Creating Channel Groups

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Channel groups allow communities to organize channels in separated categories.

Channel groups are configured in the `Customization` > `Channels & Groups` tab.

### Add a Group

To add a new channel group, select the green `+` icon to the right of the group bar.

Enter in a new group name, and select `Ok`.

### Edit or Delete a Group

Select the gear icon on the group to rename it.

Select the trash icon on the group to remove it.

Re-order the channel groups via drag-and-drop.

### Shared Channels

Shared channels let you create a single channel that exists across multiple groups.

#### Setup

In this example, there are three radio groups — `City`, `Highway`, and `County`. Each group has its own `Interops` channel, but these channels are linked together so that any transmission on one `Interops` channel is heard across all three groups.

This setup allows seamless communication between departments while maintaining their individual group structures.

1. **Determine the "Primary" Channel**

* One channel must be chosen as the "Primary" channel that the other channels link to. In this example, we will select the `City` group's `Interops`.

2. **Link the First Channel to Primary**

* In the `Highway` group, edit the `Highway Interops` channel. Toggle the channel mode to `Shared` and select the `City Interops` channel (our "primary" channel).

3. **Link the Second Channel to Primary**

* In the `County` group, edit the `County Interops` channel. Toggle the channel mode to `Shared` and select the `City Interops` channel (our "primary" channel).

Now, any user in the City, Highway, or County Interops channel will appear in all three and any transmissions in one will be heard in all three.

## Channels

Channels are inside of groups and are what users connect to in order to communicate.

You can create a channel in the `Customization` > `Channels & Groups` tab, or right inside of the `Dispatch` panel.

* Select the gear icon on the channel to rename it.
* Select the plus icon in the server settings or dispatch panel to add a new channel.
* Select the gear icon > trash icon to delete the channel.

When creating a channel, you only need to provide a name.
