## Customizing the Voice Effect

Sonoran Radio allows you to create custom voice effect styles for users talking in the radio.

Expand the `Digital`, `Analog` and `Equalizer` boxes for specific customizations.

By clicking the microphone icon and using the signal strength slider, you can hear how the effect will sound when users are talking.

## Applying the Voice Effect

In the [channel editor, you can select the desired voice effect](configure-channels.md#setting-the-voice-effect). This voice effect will apply to anyone talking in that channel.
