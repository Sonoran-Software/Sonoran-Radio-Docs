### Technical Information

When an active radio is on within 15 game units of a player, they will hear the live radio chatter emitting  from the closest radio. If there are additional radios within range connected to additional channels, the player will hear those additional channels emitting from the closest radio source.

_This feature is experimental and subject to change and improvements._
