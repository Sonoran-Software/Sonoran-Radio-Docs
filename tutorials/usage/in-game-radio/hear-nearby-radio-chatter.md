### Technical Information

When a player is within 15 game units of an active radio, they will hear the live chatter from the nearest radio. If multiple radios within range are tuned to different channels, the player will hear all those channels blended, but the sound will primarily emit from the closest radio source.

_This feature is experimental and subject to both change and improvements._
