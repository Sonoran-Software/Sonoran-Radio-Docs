## Usage

### Audio Permissions

Due to browser restrictions, audio playback on a user's device requires user interaction. When users join the server, they will be prompted to press any key to activate Sonoran Radio.

Afterwards, they will be able to hear nearby radio chatter.

### Adjust Volume

Players can adjust the nearby radio volume in-game using the `/radiovolume` command.

Ex: `/radiovolume 75` sets the nearby radio to 75% volume.

### Technical Information

When a player is within 15 game units of an active radio, they will hear the live chatter from the nearest radio. If multiple radios within range are tuned to different channels, the player will hear all those channels blended, but the sound will primarily emit from the closest radio source.

_This feature is experimental and subject to both change and improvements._
