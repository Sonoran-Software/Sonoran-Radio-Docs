# Geo Channels

Geo channels let you define in-game zones that automatically switch your transmitting and scanned channels based on your location.

For example, entering a downtown area can automatically switch your radio to the **City** channel, while driving on the highway can switch it to the **Highway** channel.

## Creating Geo Zones

### Via Radio Panel

<details>

<summary>Geo Zones via Radio Panel</summary>

In the **Geo Zone** tab, use the polygon, rectangle, or circle tool to create a custom zone on the map. Select the zone to customize the name, z coordinates (floor and ceiling height), and the channels to automatically transmit and scan when entered.

Additionally, you can enter comma separated ACE permissions for the zone. When configured, the zone will only apply to users with those ACE permissions.
