# Error Codes

## ERR 101: Unable to get webBaseURL

Sonoran Radio uses your CFX Nucleus Proxy URL to send push events from the radio to your game server. For example, this allows playing a tone on the radio to an in-game speaker.

Your CFX proxy URL follows the format: `https://yourCFXUsername.users.cfx.re/`, where `yourCFXUsername` is your unique CFX username. This proxy is a built-in feature for all FiveM servers.

If you encounter this error, please reach out to your FiveM server host for assistance.
