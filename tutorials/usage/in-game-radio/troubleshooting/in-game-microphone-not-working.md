# In-Game Microphone Not Working

## In-Game Microphone Not Working

Due to an old version of Chromium (web browser) that FiveM utilizes, we are unable to change audio devices in-game. FiveM utilizes your "default" Windows microphone.

To resolve this issue, simply set your desired microphone "as default" in Windows.

### 1. Control Panel Sound

Open the `Control Panel` and select `Hardware and Sound`
