## Accessing the Connected Users List

In-game, users can utilize the `/radiousers` command to open the connected users window.

This window displays all active users connected to the radio, and the channel they are in.

## ACE Permission Restrictions

Communities can restrict access to this command with ACE permissions:

{% content-ref url="configuring-ace-permissions.md" %}
[configuring-ace-permissions.md](configuring-ace-permissions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
