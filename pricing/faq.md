# Are subscriptions a one-time payment, or monthly?

All subscriptions will be charged on a monthy basis, until cancelled.

Subscriptions are renewed one month after the start date. You will receive an email from Stripe a few days before you are charged again. This way, you aren't charged again without prior notice.

# What happens if my subscription expires? Will I lose my settings?

Currently, some of your settings are permanently deleted if it does not meet the subscription plan. However, it is planned that in the future they will simply be disabled instead of completely removed.
