## Managing / Cancelling a Plan

You are able to manage and cancel your subscription in the [Sonoran Radio billing portal](https://sonoranradio.com/billing).

## Migrate a Subscription

You can migrate a subscription to a different server, or apply an existing Sonoran One subscription, by pressing `Set Server` on the subscription in the [billing portal](https://sonoranradio.com/#/billing).&#x20;

## Are subscriptions a one-time payment, or monthly?

With Sonoran Radio, you have the option to choose either a monthly or quarterly subscription. We offer multiple different subscription plans at different price ranges. You can [compare our plans](https://sonoranradio.com/pricing) to see what works best for your community.

By choosing a **quarterly subscription**, you are automatically given a **25% discount**. The quarterly plan can be selected in Stripe at checkout by toggling the `Save $XX with 3-month billing` option.

Monthly subscriptions are renewed one month after the start date, and quarterly subscriptions are renewed three months after the start date. You will receive an email from Stripe a few days before you are charged again. This way, you aren't charged again without prior notice.

Due to ongoing server hosting, development, maintenance, and customer support costs, we are unable to offer a yearly or lifetime subscription at this time.

## What happens if my subscription expires? Will I lose my settings?

Currently, some of your settings are permanently deleted if it does not meet the subscription plan. However, it is planned that in the future they will simply be disabled instead of completely removed.

## Military and First Responder Discount

&#x20;As part of our commitment to serving the community, we deeply value the relentless effort and dedication displayed by our military and first responders, day in and day out. All U.S. military personnel, police officers, firefighters, and paramedics qualify for a 15% monthly discount.
