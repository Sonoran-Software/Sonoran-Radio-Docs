You can open this configuration file with a text editor and change values.

For more information on the configuration options, you can view the [in-game resource's guide](../../ts3-legacy/tutorials/getting-started/in-game-radio.md) page and scroll down to the configuration section.

If you modify a configuration file, be sure to save it and restart the server.
